                <h2 class="display-6">Purpose</h2>
                <p>To address these challenges, the complex, multivariate and unpredictable agricultural ecosystems need
                    to be better understood by monitoring, measuring and analyzing continuously various physical aspects
                    and phenomena.</p>

                <h2 class="display-6">Quality</h2>
                <p>As a farmer its task is to culture butterflies with extra care management by maintaining the
                    indicator host plant for sustainability needs in butterfly farming or propagation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xl-3 text-center">
                <img src="imgs/icon-3.png">
                <h2 class="display-6">Function</h2>
                <p>In order to have knowledge about the lepidoptera, the cultured species are examined sequentially and
                    adaptively identified by the researcher. The system should decide on the precise tasks,and
                    predicting model such as segmenting images, detecting objects in images, or classifying images.</p>

                <img src="imgs/icon-4.png">
                <h2 class="display-6">Elegant</h2>
                <p>With the ability to adapt and learn from new data, machine learning models can refine their breeding
                    strategies and improve quality performance, helping breeders stay ahead in an ever-evolving and
                    dynamic biodiversity. As markets become more data-driven and sophisticated, the integration of
                    machine learning in breeding is no longer a luxury but a necessity for those seeking a competitive
                    edge.
